We should try to see the form with Lindsay at some point.
schedule a time next Tuesday?
* Goal
Make list of things, bugs we might run into, bugs in the old form, etc.
* The List
- cases, capitalizations, putting invalid responses in fields, breaking word limits
- same names 
  - fixed by using ID number as primary identifier for subject
- 2 professors teaching the same course asking for the same materials
  - if one professor reserves multiple chapters from the same book
- same item (s) reserved by multiple people
- what if url is taken down during time of submission
- page count, is there a way to check the max page count? 
  - ex: people asking for 1--200 pages of a 100 page book
- what if the item isn't available (already borrowed) or 2 item isn't in the library at all
- *required fields must be completed to check out
- make sure items have unique identifier (ISPN)
- author/director/composer/lead option for material items (not required)
- for course selection, include section?
- For materials, item 7. what does it even mean?!
  - requires personal copy or library owned, what if you don't know?
- WHAT IS THE LIBRARY CALL# !?!??!?!?!?!??

* Things We May Want
- better circulation options
- alert for late returns
- actual time specifications for materials with max of 3 days, based off of date the materials are needed
* Things The Library Wants
- for electronic reserves, a 15th item "call# for book: _______"
