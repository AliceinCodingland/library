Software Development Plan
=========================

Timeline
========

Format your timeline like the following:

	March 30:
	- Some goal to be completed by the thirtieth of march
	- some other goal

	April 1:
	- Who makes goals on April Fools'?
	- I mean, that's just *asking* for trouble.

I will format the above as a pretty thing once all the content is there;
  Github-Flavored Markdown does not have the ability to create definition lists.
([Kramdown][1] does, however... I do wish there was support for different engines.)
